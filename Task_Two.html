      Web development has always fascinated me. I recently started learning
      HTML, and it's amazing how simple tags can create structured content.
      <br />
      Understanding how the web works from the ground up is both exciting and
      rewarding. Every webpage starts with a foundation, and HTML
      <br />
      provides that structure. Though it's just the beginning, I can already see
      how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. My goal is to build
      <br />
      interactive and dynamic websites that provide a great user experience.
